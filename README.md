Work in progress.

Please check before making a pull request as the program is under constant development and contribution guidelines have not been finalized.    
If you have a suggestion, please send it through one of the methods mentioned on the webpage.    
Please do not use Issues yet as the program is in an early state and I have many notes for things to fix or improve.

Contributing:
- Please provide adequate explanation for the reason for making a pull request.
- If a change addresses an Issue, always link it.

Code standards:
- Every named function (except the standard methods for routines) must have a docstring and any lines that could be confusing in any way should be commented.
- No ES6+ syntax or features except for Promises.
- In terms of game data, try to keep code adaptable to changes in values or structures.

Code style:
- Always semicolons and block braces.
- Always strict equality.
- Always trailing commas except for inlines that won't change.
- Always use `this` for the program object when possible.
- Lines must fit comfortably on a 1920x1080 display.
- Spacing and formatting conventions:
-- Inline comments on the same line as code have no preceding space and one space before the text of the comment.
- When in doubt, check existing code.
