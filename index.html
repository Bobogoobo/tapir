	<h2>Log Information Parser (TAPIR LIP)</h2>
	<h3>Instructions</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Enter an API key. To read your log it must be Full Access. Your browser may allow you to save it as a password for quick use on this page.</li>
		<li>Set options. Most selections are not required. On your first full run, I recommend storing logs and leaving other settings alone, but you can also do a limited run to try it out.</li>
		<li>Start the program.
			<ul>
				<li>For your first full run:
					<ol>
						<li>Enable the option to store logs, then click "Run From Torn API". It may take a very long time to run depending on how long and how frequently you've been playing.</li>
						<li>When it is done, the Torn Logs field will populate. Click "Copy to Clipboard", open up Notepad or equivalent, paste, and save somewhere convenient.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>For subsequent runs:
					<ol>
						<li>Click the file selection button next to "Choose saved log file" and select the log file you previously saved.</li>
						<li>Click the Submit button to load the log data into the program.</li>
						<li>Choose routines to run by clicking the "Show list of routines" button (this is optional).</li>
						<li>Click "Run From Stored Data".</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Note: you can also run from stored data after doing a full run without needing a file, if you chose to save the logs and haven't refreshed the page.</li>
				<li>Any errors or potential issues the program encounters will be logged in the "Program Logs" area.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>If you refresh the page, you will need to follow these steps again. Your browser may save your selections for you, but the file will always need to be submitted again.</li>
	</ol>

			<h3>Limit number of logs retrieved</h3>
			<p>If using multiple limits, the first limit hit will stop the program. You can limit to 0 logs if you want to run a routine that doesn't use them.</p>

	<h3>Routines</h3>
	<div id="routines-output"><span>Program not started yet.</span></div>
	<hr />
	<h2>Known Issues / Planned Features</h2>
	<p>When reporting a bug, please include any errors in the browser console (F12) and how to reproduce it.</p>
	<p>Many more ideas for features and routines are already noted, but feel free to suggest specific ideas (requests help prioritize development).</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Output of routines should have some nice formatting and they should be easier to navigate. Page needs to be more visually appealing in general.</li>
		<li>Mobile support and keyboard interfacing should be added.</li>
		<li>Progress indicators do not take limits into account. Limits are not always followed correctly. Limiting to 0 logs does not terminate properly.</li>
		<li>Analyze Log fails with console error if run without first doing something else to call the API.</li>
		<li>API error codes are not specifically checked and may result in program errors.</li>
		<li>Re-running without refreshing the page may not always work as expected.</li>
		<li>Log file should be easier to update.</li>
		<li>Some API inconsistencies have not yet been accounted for and not all issues have been found. Additional non-API data is still to be added.</li>
		<li>Program start/end time should be tracked in ms.</li>
		<li>Racing routine does not work without license acquisition being in the read logs.</li>
	</ul>
	<hr />
	<h2>Log Versions</h2>
	<p>
		If the version in your log file does not match the most recent version (listed first), data may not be read properly by the program.
		<br />
		To update to a more recent version, you will need to adjust the data manually. This may be automated in the future.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>v0.1.0 - 2022-08-07
			<ul>
				<li>Initial limited test release. Many changes to API data to make it more concise, consistent, and program readable.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
